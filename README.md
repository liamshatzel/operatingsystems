# Operating Systems
Doing some OS explorations as a side quest

## Shell
* Run the shell by doing `make` then `./a1`.
* It supports most terminal commands try: `ls -l` or `ps -ef`
* For background processes try: `bg ./inf` and `bglist` (`kill -9 [pid]` to kill processes)
* You can also change directories, try: `cd ~` or `cd`
